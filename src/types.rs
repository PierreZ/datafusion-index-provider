//! Core type definitions for representing index-based filter operations.

//! This module defines the [`IndexFilter`] enum which represents the structure of
//! filter operations that can be pushed down to indexes. These types form the
//! foundation for the query optimization and execution plan generation process.

/// Represents the structure of filter expressions that can be executed using indexes.
///
/// This enum captures the hierarchical structure of filter conditions and their
/// mapping to physical indexes. It serves as an intermediate representation between
/// SQL filter expressions and physical execution plans.
///
/// ## Execution Plan Mapping
/// Each variant maps to a specific execution strategy:
/// - `Single`: Direct index scan via `IndexScanExec`
/// - `And`: Index intersection via cascaded joins (Hash or SortMerge joins)
/// - `Or`: Index union via `UnionExec` + `AggregateExec` for deduplication

    /// results intersected to find rows that satisfy ALL conditions. The execution
    /// strategy builds a left-deep tree of joins to progressively narrow the result set.

/// A collection of [`IndexFilter`]s representing a complete index-based query plan.
///
/// This type represents the complete set of index operations needed to satisfy a query's

/// serves as input to `create_execution_plan_with_indexes()` for physical plan generation.
